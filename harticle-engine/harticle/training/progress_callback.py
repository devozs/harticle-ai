"""Trainer callback that bridges HuggingFace training to the polling protocol.

On every step it reports epoch/step/loss/percent to management and reads back the
cooperative-stop flag (the cross-network analogue of the scraper's
``isCancelRequested()``). On a stop request it saves a checkpoint, uploads it, and
asks the Trainer to halt at the boundary. ``on_save`` mirrors checkpoints to
storage as the Trainer writes them.
